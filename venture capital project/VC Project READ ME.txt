Project Name: Predicting Start-Up Acquisitions Using Venture Capital Data

Project Status: Completed.

Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict acquisitions using venture capital data using Crunchbase point-in-time data as of year-end 2013. 
Provided data includes areas of investor, rounds, company, and acquisitions data. Primary consumers would be Venture Capital firms, Start-Up Founders,
and those that have a keen interest in private markets.

Methods Used
* Data Wrangling
* Data Visualization
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Predictive Modeling

Technologies 
* Python
* R
* Jupyter Notebook

Project Description

I analyzed over 19,000 companies across 58 features (four selected) using a RandomForestClassifier. Multi-class labels included Operating, Acquired, IPO,
and Closed. Achieved 87% accuracy (F1 = 84%) using a 60/40 train/test split. Model achieved accuracy on binary basis (acquired/operating), but failed
to extend to a multi-class use.

Further Needs of this project

* Updated data (in particular, more acquisition instances)
* More granular investor level data
* Re-optimization of investor scores to boost feature importantance (hunch)  

Featured Notebooks/Analysis/Deliverables
* Venture Capital Data - Wrangling Update.py

Wrangles four dataframes into combined Company level dataframe. Takes rounds and investor dataframes from long format to wide format. Also calculates 
investor scores for each company by round (14 max rounds).

* Venture Capital Data - EDA.ipynb

Granular and summary views of data in each of the four dataframes and combined dataframe. 

* Venture Capital ML Walkthrough.ipynb

Walkthrough of RandomForestClassifier implementation from beginning to end. 

* Venture Capital ML Update.py

More granular view of code used to implement RandomForestClassifier.
